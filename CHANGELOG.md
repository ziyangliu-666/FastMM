# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here (Keep a Changelog format).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Binance Spot Demo Mode: `configs/binance-demo.toml`, and `FASTMM_BINANCE_ENV=demo` for the live
  test. The live test passed against Demo Mode (book sync, far post-only order, cancel, cancel-all).
- CI builds the Docker image and runs the compose stack for 20 seconds.

### Fixed
- Bybit positions deduct `spotBorrow` from `walletBalance` (the net holding; `locked` coins were
  already included, as the wallet docs define).
- Bybit `rejectReason` values map to specific reasons (duplicate id, unknown order, self-trade
  prevention, price scale, zero quantity, price limits) instead of a guessed "Balance" match.
- Binance `GET /api/v3/time` is counted with weight 1, as documented.
- Comments that said VERIFY now cite what the Bybit and Binance docs state (Bybit sequencing and
  amend quantity, Binance listenKey removal from 2026-02-20).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Repository skeleton: CMake + CPM with pinned dependencies, presets (debug, release, release-native,
  asan, tsan, coverage, clang, python), GitHub Actions CI, clang-format / clang-tidy, pre-commit.
- `fastmm::core`: fixed-point `Price`/`Qty`/`Notional`, TSC clock, lock-free SPSC rings, `.fmj`
  journal, async logger, latency histograms, L2 and L3 order books with snapshot/delta sync, OMS,
  risk engine, quote manager, `Engine<Strategy, Clock, Transport, Feed>`, BasicMM and
  Avellaneda-Stoikov strategies, TOML configuration with env-var secrets.
- `fastmm::net`: epoll reactor, non-blocking TCP, OpenSSL TLS over BIO pairs, WebSocket client and
  server, HTTP/1.1 client and server, reconnecting connection state machine.
- `fastmm::sim`: price-time matching engine, seeded latency model, queue-position fill model,
  synthetic market generator, simulated transport and driver, journal replay with an outbound hash.
- `fastmm::backtest`: journal, CSV, numpy-array and synthetic data sources, fees, PnL and metrics,
  parameter sweeps; `fastmm-backtest` and `fastmm-replay` apps; golden replay fixture.
- Python research bindings (`pip install -e .`): `run_backtest` and `sweep` with the GIL released,
  zero-copy numpy inputs and result columns, pandas conversion, an `OrderBook` research class,
  strategy parameter schemas, `enable_logging` for the C++ logger, and quickstart / sweep examples.
- `fastmm::venues`: Binance Spot and Bybit v5 connectors (snapshot and delta book sync, WebSocket
  order entry with REST fallback, HMAC and Ed25519 auth, reconciliation, rate limiting) with
  fixtures recorded from both testnets and scripted in-process fake exchanges; `fastmm-live` with
  dry-run, raw recording, journaling and a kill switch that cancels everything on shutdown.
- `fastmm-sim-exchange`: a Binance-compatible simulated exchange (REST, combined market-data
  streams, WS API order entry, user data stream, legacy listenKey) over TCP and TLS, driven by the
  matching engine and a seeded market generator, with signature, `recvWindow` and rate-limit checks
  and one-shot or counted fault injection (dropped connections, skipped depth updates, `-1021`,
  unresponsive REST, delayed acks, rejects, 429s). Conformance and end-to-end tests run
  `fastmm-live` against it; `scripts/run-sim.sh` and `docker compose up` start both.
- Connector-specific venue keys (`stale_ms`, `order_api`, `depth`, ...) are validated and documented
  instead of being reported as unknown.
- The strategy registry keeps one factory per transport kind, so backtest and live registrations of
  the same strategy coexist.
- Periodic TSC recalibration in `fastmm-live` (`[engine] tsc_recalibrate_s`, default 10 s): the main
  thread measures and publishes calibrations through a seqlock, and the engine's clock re-anchors
  without going backwards (it steps, counts and logs when it was more than 1 ms off).
  `ControlCommand::RecalibrateTsc` applies a published calibration immediately. Measured offsets are
  slewed away over one period (at most 500 ppm) rather than accumulated until the clock has to step.
- Network-thread order latency for Binance and Bybit: encode, send and receive-to-wire
  tick-to-trade per venue in `VenueStatus`, printed by `fastmm-live` in the stats line and the
  final summary.
- `fastmm-live` registers its strategies as `TransportKind::Live` factories in the strategy
  registry; `--list-strategies` lists what supports live trading.
- Simulated venue rejects are broken down by cause (post-only cross, level table full, invalid,
  duplicate, other).
- Benchmarks for books, rings, OMS, risk, quote manager, logger, journal, WebSocket, HTTP, matching
  and tick-to-order, with p50 budgets checked by `tools/check_budgets.py`.
- Documentation: architecture overview, ADR 0001-0011, configuration reference, strategy and venue
  guides.

### Fixed
- `Logger::instance()` wired its implementation with an unsynchronised null check, so threads
  that logged for the first time at the same moment (parallel sweep workers warming up their
  engines) raced on it and on the ring table. It now relies on thread-safe static
  initialisation, which also destroys the logger before the state its destructor uses.
- A quote slot could stop quoting for good after a connection loss. After a replace the quote
  manager still remembered the order's original id, so the terminal update of a later cancel was
  dropped and the slot waited for it forever. Slots now recognise their order by handle, instrument
  and tag, and a slot without a live order never waits. Found on a 2-core CI runner, where the
  market-data end-to-end test stopped quoting after the reconnect.
- Orders still pending when quotes were pulled (a New or a replace awaiting its ack) stayed on the
  book once acknowledged. They are now cancelled as soon as they become working.
- The quote manager could take a stale handle for the order that later reused its slot and
  replace or cancel that order.
- Avellaneda-Stoikov never requoted on the first book update after a reconnect: its variance
  update wrote the mid back into the field that gates requotes. The two are separate now.
- Several sources used `<algorithm>` and `<cstdio>` functions without including those headers.
  They compiled against libstdc++ 13 through transitive includes but not against libstdc++ 14, which
  clang picks up on the GitHub ubuntu-24.04 image.
- CI sized for the private-repository runner (2 vCPUs): builds and tests use the core count, the
  build job limit is 60 minutes, and integration tests run serially.
- The clang-tsan build did not link: the hot-path allocation harness replaces global `operator new`,
  which the TSan runtime also defines. The harness is no longer built under TSan.
- Under TSan every concurrent `Seqlocked` store and load was reported as a data race. The optimistic
  copy is racy by design, so TSan builds now serialise it with a spinlock; other builds are unchanged.
- `scripts/tidy.sh` also analysed dependency sources in the CPM cache, whose paths contain `src/`.
- The seqlock torn-write test failed on one core or under a loaded `ctest -j`, because the writer
  could finish before the reader was first scheduled.
- TSC recalibration re-measured the rate over a 50 ms window every time. On a virtualised host the
  resulting rate noise (hundreds to thousands of ppm) drifted the engine clock by milliseconds
  between recalibrations and stepped it every 10 s. The rate is now measured over the whole
  interval since the previous anchor against `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`, and host wall-clock steps are
  reported separately.
- A requested shutdown logged a spurious "cancel-all failed" error: closing the order channel
  started an asynchronous cancel-all that the disconnect then aborted. It is skipped during an
  intentional disconnect, and a kill switch requested by the control thread logs a warning
  instead of an error.
- Binance and Bybit connectors did not reconcile open orders after the order channel reconnected,
  and the user/private streams re-queried open orders every time a quiet stream returned from
  Stale. Reconciliation now runs exactly on real reconnects.
- After a reconnect BasicMM and Avellaneda-Stoikov stayed unquoted until the mid moved past the
  requote threshold; they now requote as soon as the venue is Live again.
- `fastmm-live` lost the PnL and fee figures of its final summary to the logger's string-argument
  cap; the summary is logged as numbers, and truncated string arguments now end in `...`.
- Order book sync resynced needlessly on Binance when no buffered delta was newer than the REST
  snapshot: the first live delta was checked with the "follows exactly" rule and an overlapping
  delta (U <= L+1 <= u) looked like a gap. It is now checked with the first-delta rule.
- Stack buffer overflow when a `BookDeltaMsg` was built by value: its `hdr.len` is longer than the
  struct. Messages are now always built in correctly sized buffers.
- Division by zero in the L3 book benchmark on longer runs.
- Logger ring slots were never released by exiting threads, so repeated sweeps eventually dropped
  all log records.
- BasicMM could skew a post-only quote through the market and have it rejected; quotes are now
  kept one tick inside the touch.
- Replay hashes included latency stamps and differed between the original run and the replay.
- Recorded-data fills applied level increases before decreases within one update.
- The example backtest capped inventory at one quote size, so one side stopped quoting whenever
  the strategy held inventory (0.3% quote uptime); it now allows five and keeps both sides quoted.
- Examples and sweep tables no longer headline an annualised Sharpe computed from minutes of
  synthetic data; they show the per-bar Sharpe and split PnL into spread and maker rebates.
- sim, backtest and bindings build cleanly under clang `-Werror` and clang-tidy.
- CI: invalid workflow YAML, TSan on high-entropy ASLR kernels, clang `-Werror` failures, clang-tidy
  errors, redundant `pip install cmake`, oversized Docker build context, bootstrap treating CMake 4
  as too old.
